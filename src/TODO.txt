TODO*
# Basic or so we hope :P
- Get proper ship handling 
- Get crosshair to move with mouse ( basically fix up the whole gui system )
- Get Scale correct
- Make a starfield effect


# Later / Advance
- Add physics
- Setup Collisions
- Get Planets to rotate around Sun (real-time effect)
- Design a planet generator ( This deppend on the way we want to make planets.) 
  We could go for normal looks or we could go for procedural planet generation with nice detail... but yea thats another story.
- Design a astroid generator


# Extras
- Get xyzView more accurate, So we can use it for scaling and Hpr checking."1:1" Though we have to redo the current scale!
