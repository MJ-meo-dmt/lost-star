Project lost-star 3D Space Game.

Working on a Galaxy Spiral. (With loads of star systems)

At the moment focusing on space travel, and other basic things including Planet orbiting around Sun in real-time.  

Next up is basic combat system.( make the ship shoot stuff :P )

Will look into adding RPG elements later on.
- Similar to that of Eve online, Freelancer e.g. not making an MMO!.

- Single-player play style similar to Oblivion being able to roam the whole system.  That said the system being populated with all kinds of different things.

- AI
